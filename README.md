## Dynamic_Movment_Primtives (DMP)
In DMP,state-action pairs of the desired task are recorded from the human demonstrations either kinesthetically or via teleoperation. Then, the robot learns to regenerate and generalize the demonstrated motions. Satisfactory results were obtained in applying DMP approaches in different applications such as in generating the whole body dancing motions for a biped humanoid robot, handwriting robotic applications, obstacle avoidance of robotic arm and mobile robots.

These functions represents the implemnetation of DMP of the robot's tip posiiton including its position and orientation. The data used here is a real data captured during the motion of soft robot.

Please follow the following steps before cimpilng the code:
* pip install --upgrade pip
* pip install pyquaternion
* pip install spatialmath-python
* pip install SciencePlots
